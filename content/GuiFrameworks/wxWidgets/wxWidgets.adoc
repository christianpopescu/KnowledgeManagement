== Introduction

As stated on the official site (see references).

*wxWidgets* is a C++ library that lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, Linux and other platforms with a single code base.

It has popular language bindings for _Python_, _Perl_, *Ruby* and many other languages, and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI.
