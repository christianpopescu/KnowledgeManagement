== Introduction

As stated on the official site (see references).

*wxWidgets* is a C++ library that lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, Linux and other platforms with a single code base.

It has popular language bindings for _Python_, _Perl_, _Ruby_ and many other languages, and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI.

=== Installation and Build

==== Windows + Visual Studio

I am going to test and document the installation and the build of a solution based on different documentation found on site.

I'll use the development version 3.1.5.

If you are using one of the supported compiler, like Visual Studio C++ compiler, you can use *the prebuild binaries*.

https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/plat_msw_binaries.html

The binaries are available at: https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads#v3.1.5_msw
