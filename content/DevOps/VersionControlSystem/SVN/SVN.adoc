== Synchronize repository

To synchronize two repositories use the following command

    svnsync synchronize destination source

If we receive the error message: _svnsync: E000022: Destination repository has not been initialized_ the repository should be intialized with the command.

    svnsync initialize dest source --allow-non-empty

After that we can run the synchronization command.


=== Example

    svnsync initialize "file:///e:/ccp_vhdd_svn/ProjectsSoftwareEngineering"  https://helixteamhub.cloud/.../subversion/ProjectsSoftwareEngineering --allow-non-empty

    svnsync sync  https://helixteamhub.cloud/.../subversion/ProjectsSoftwareEngineering
