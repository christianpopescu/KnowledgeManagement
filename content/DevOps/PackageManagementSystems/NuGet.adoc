= Introduction

NuGet is the package manager for .NET. The NuGet client tools provide the ability to produce and consume packages.

== Command line tools

* dotnet.exe CLI

The .NET Core CLI, dotnet.exe, works on all platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and provides core NuGet features such as installing, restoring, and publishing packages. dotnet provides direct integration with .NET Core project files (such as .csproj), which is helpful in most scenarios. dotnet is also built directly for each platform and does not require you to install Mono.

* nuget.exe CLI

The nuget.exe CLI, nuget.exe, is the command-line utility for Windows that provides all NuGet capabilities.

=== Configuration

=== Package information

* List packages for a given source

    nuget list -Source http://localhost:8081/repository/Sandbox_new

* Install package to a given project (packages folder)

    nuget install <packageID> -OutputDirectory packages

* Remove package

To delete one or more packages, delete the packages you want to remove from the *packages* folder.

If you want to reinstall packages, use the _restore_ or _install_ command.

* Viewing folder locations

    # Display locals for all folders: global-packages, http cache, temp and plugins cache
    nuget locals all -list

Typicaly output:

    http-cache: C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\NuGet\v3-cache
    global-packages: C:\Users\user1\.nuget\packages\
    temp: C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Temp\NuGetScratch
    plugins-cache: C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\NuGet\plugins-cache

=== What happens when a NuGet package is installed

the different NuGet tools typically create a reference to a package in the project file or packages.config, then perform a package restore, which effectively installs the package. The exception is nuget install, which only expands the package into a packages folder and does not modify any other files.

The general process is as follows:

. (All tools except nuget.exe) Record the package identifier and version into the project file or packages.config.

. Acquire the package

. Save a copy of the package and other information in the _http-cache_ folder.

. If downloaded, install the package into the per-user global-packages folder.

. NuGet installs package dependencies as required.

. Update other project files and folders:

.. For projects using PackageReference, update the package dependency graph stored in obj/project.assets.json. Package contents themselves are not copied into any project folder.

.. Update app.config and/or web.config if the package uses source and config file transformations.

. (Visual Studio only) Display the package's readme file, if available, in a Visual Studio window.
