== SSH

*Secure Shell (SSH)* is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.[1] Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.


=== Unix

In Unix, *ssh-agent* is a background program that handles passwords for SSH private keys.
 
The *ssh-add* command prompts the user for a private key password and adds it to the list maintained by ssh-agent. Once you add a password to ssh-agent, you will not be prompted for it when using SSH or scp to connect to hosts with your public key.


1. Start *ssh-agent*

	 eval `ssh-agent`
	 
Note. Use (`) backcote and not simple cote.
 +
2. Add key
	
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/my_credentials
