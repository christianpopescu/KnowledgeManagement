The purpose of this document is to describe how  to install different servers on Linux.


= Oracle server

== How to Install Oracle Database 12c on RHEL/CentOS 7


Note. The installation is done on RHEL/CentOS Gui server

After installing Oracle 12c, the configuration will be performed through a graphical interface. That is the reason why we need a CentOS 7 server with the X Window System software group installed.
